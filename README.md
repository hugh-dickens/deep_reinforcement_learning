# deep_reinforcement_learning
This deep reinforcement learning coursework was carried out both as a tutorial and the first part of a coursework. The goal was to move from start to goal, navigating around an obstacle. environment.py creates the environment for the agent to navigate and starter_code.py carries out the reinforcement learning.

On completion of this section, a deep-Q network could then be constructed. The main aim was to familiarise us with a few different deep reinforcement learning algorithms as well to practise visualising the results.

Example of Q-value visualisation:
